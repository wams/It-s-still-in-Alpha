NEVER WORK ON THE MASTER BRANCH!

Start Up:
Step 1: Create a new branch( Just use your name for now ).
Step 2: Never commit to the master branch.
Step 3: Commit work only to your local branch.

When want everyone else to get your commits:
Step 1: switch to the master branch
Step 2: sync the master branch
Step 3: merge your local branch into the master branch
Step 4: check the program compiles
Step 5: sync the master branch
Step 6: merge the master branch into your local branch.
Step 7: Party hearty!

If you have any trouble it should only occur when merging your 
local copy into the master branch, if you have a problem at any
other time stop and wait for help. If you can't solve the merging 
problem within 5 mins then stop and wait for help.

Hopefully, we won't have any problems.
